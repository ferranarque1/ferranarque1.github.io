This website was mainly inspired by Gabriel Peyré's [*Mathematical Tours of Data Sciences*](https://mathematical-tours.github.io/), so I think it's only fair to put it at the top of the page. It was created as a companion website to [*Numerical Tours of Data Sciences*](http://www.numerical-tours.com/) (another great resource), and it explains the mathematics underlying the concepts presented there, mainly related to image and signal processing and machine learning. Most texts are mathematically dense, so I wouldn't recommend them for all audiences, but for example I found [this text on discriminative and generative neural networks](https://mathematical-tours.github.io/book-basics-sources/neural-networks-en/NeuralNetworksEN.pdf) to be a good introduction on the topic.

I'll keep updating this page with whatever I find that is interesting. Here's the list organized by topics:

### Machine Learning/Deep Learning

- Original U-Net paper [[<ins>source</ins>](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/)]

    Brief, nicely written, and easy to follow. Also, it was the first network I ever used, so I think this architecture was a good introduction on how to implement a convolutional network for image segmentation.
