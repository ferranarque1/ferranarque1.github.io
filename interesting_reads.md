This website was mainly inspired by Gabriel Peyr√©'s [_*Mathematical Tours of Data Sciences*_](https://mathematical-tours.github.io/), so I think it's only fair to put it at the top of the page. It was created as a companion website to [_Numerical Tours of Data Sciences_](http://www.numerical-tours.com/) (another great resource), and it explains the mathematics underlying the concepts presented there, mainly related to image and signal processing and machine learning. Most texts are mathematically dense, so I wouldn't recommend them for all audiences, but for example I found [this text on discriminative and generative neural networks](https://mathematical-tours.github.io/book-basics-sources/neural-networks-en/NeuralNetworksEN.pdf) to be a good introduction on the topic.
